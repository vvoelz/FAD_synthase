# Molecular simulation model of *C. ammoniagenes* FAD synthase in complex with ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup> and FMN

* `build_topologies` - contains work to build AMBER topologies for use with the GROMACS simulation package
* `solvation_equilibration` - steps to add Mg2+, add solvent and ions, minimize and equilibrate
